**Project Overview**

This project aims to build a predictive model to help an insurance company's marketing team identify which customers are likely to purchase their products. Additionally, recommendations are provided to enhance the chances of customer conversion.

**Dataset Description**

The dataset used for this project contains 595,212 observations with 59 features. Due to privacy concerns, the names of the features have not been provided. Thus, the project skips exploratory data analysis (EDA) and focuses directly on model development.

Domain: Finance

Dataset: Insurance Claim Dataset

**Objectives**

Build multiple predictive models and compare their performance.
Select the best model for production based on performance metrics.
Provide a detailed report of challenges encountered during data processing and modeling, along with the techniques used to overcome them.
Key Deliverables
